### Introduction
* Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and its used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together. 
* The object, that joins these unrelated interfaces, is called an Adapter.

### Example

* The main use of this pattern is when a class that you need to use doesnâ€™t meet the requirements of an interface.
* BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
  1. System.in is static instance of InputStream, reads the data from the console in bytes stream.
  2. BufferedReader, reads a character stream.
  3. System.in provides byte stream where BufferedReader expects character stream. How they will work together?
  4. ideal situation to put a adapter in between two incompatible interfaces.
  5. InputStreamReader does exactly this thing and works adapter between System.in and BufferedReader.
