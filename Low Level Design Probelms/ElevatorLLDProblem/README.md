# Elevator System (LLD)

## Problem Statement

Design and implement an Elevator System that can handle multiple requests, move between floors, and manage direction and state efficiently.

---

## Requirements

- **Multiple Elevator:** The system manages multiple elevators.
- **Request Handling:** The system can handle requests to move to specific floors in a given direction (UP/DOWN).
- **Direction Management:** The elevator maintains and updates its current direction (UP, DOWN, IDLE).
- **State Management:** The elevator tracks its current floor, direction, and pending requests.
- **Efficient Movement:** The elevator processes requests in an efficient order (e.g., all UP requests, then all DOWN requests).
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add more elevators or advanced scheduling algorithms.
