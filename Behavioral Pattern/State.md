* this design pattern, allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.

#### Key Components of the State Design Pattern

1. **State:** 

* Defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the Context.

2. **Concrete States:**

* Implement the State interface and define behavior specific to a particular state of the Context.

3. **Context:**

* Maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.
